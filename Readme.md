# Bank Transaction Simulation Using Distributed Mutual Exclusion

This project simulates **distributed bank transactions** using **mutual exclusion algorithms**. Initially implemented with the **Ricart-Agrawala algorithm**, the project has been **optimized using the Roucairol-Carvalho algorithm** and a **quorum-based approach** to enhance efficiency and reduce message overhead.

> **Inspired by:**  
> [Bea2000/Distributed-Systems-Task-Ricart-Agrawala-Algorithm-for-Bank-Transactions-T1](https://github.com/Bea2000/Distributed-Systems-Task-Ricart-Agrawala-Algorithm-for-Bank-Transactions-T1)

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- **Ricart-Agrawala Algorithm**: Ensures mutual exclusion via message-passing between distributed processes.
- **Rouçairol-Carvalho Optimization**: Reduces redundant communication by not releasing permissions unnecessarily.
- **Quorum-based Mutual Exclusion**: Minimizes the number of nodes a process must coordinate with, improving scalability.

## 🛠 Why Go?

We used **Go (Golang)** because:
- It supports **concurrent programming** natively using goroutines and channels.
- It is **lightweight and fast**, ideal for networked and distributed applications.
- Built-in packages make handling **network communication**, **JSON**, and **timing** simple and efficient.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Install **Go compiler** (https://golang.org/dl/)
- (Optional) Python with `matplotlib` and `pandas` for visualization

### ▶️ Running the Simulation

#### For **Linux**:
```bash
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```

#### For **Windows** (PowerShell):
```powershell
./run_tests.ps1
```

## 🤝 Acknowledgments

This project is based on the work done in the [Distributed-Systems-Task-Ricart-Agrawala](https://github.com/Bea2000/Distributed-Systems-Task-Ricart-Agrawala-Algorithm-for-Bank-Transactions-T1) repository. Thanks to the original authors for the foundational implementation.

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure your **Go environment** is set up correctly (`$GOPATH`, `$GOROOT` if needed).
- The simulation assumes nodes can communicate using local ports and are run in parallel.
